15-112 Term Project

This is a Crossy Road inspired game with two gameplay modes. There is a regular (traditional) endless mode where the scottie attempts to accumulate a high score while avoiding obstacles. The AI mode introduces a finish line for the player to race against AI. The game also increases in difficulty in both modes as the player advances.
